opentest is effectively first check if offense attempts to score

for 3pt, only check against defense
for mid range, another check will be built (v. block down-weighted)
for close, another check will be built (v. block normal-weighted, steal upped, height check)


If passes checks,

offense takes shot @ shooting percentage listed in stat table;
stat table does not include PERCENTAGES via long, mid and close -- calculate from
bref and 82 tables


If miss,
offensive v. rebounding % checks; weighted by distance of shot / individual stats (special o for offense v. regular defense)



If make, flavor-text displays weighted random type of shot; so if close, REVERSE JAM ETC ETC;
mid-range? fade away post shot, etc

If make defenses/offense switch, and start over


moves will be:
long (3pt)
mid
close
2 specials (one O, one D); not unique but dependent on position/skill
1 unique to player
